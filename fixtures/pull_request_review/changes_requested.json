    "body": "Welcome to [Renovate](https://redirect.github.com/renovatebot/renovate)! This is an onboarding PR to help you understand and configure settings before regular Pull Requests begin.\n\nüö¶ To activate Renovate, merge this Pull Request. To disable Renovate, simply close this Pull Request unmerged.\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Configuration Summary\n\nBased on the default config's presets, Renovate will:\n\n  - Start dependency updates only once this onboarding PR is merged\n  - Show all Merge Confidence badges for pull requests.\n  - Enable Renovate Dependency Dashboard creation.\n  - Use semantic commit type `fix` for dependencies and `chore` for all others if semantic commits are in use.\n  - Ignore `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `vendor` and various test/tests (except for nuget) directories.\n  - Group known monorepo packages together.\n  - Use curated list of recommended non-monorepo package groupings.\n  - Apply crowd-sourced package replacement rules.\n  - Apply crowd-sourced workarounds for known problems with packages.\n\nüî° Do you want to change how Renovate upgrades your dependencies? Add your custom config to `renovate.json` in this branch. Renovate will update the Pull Request description the next time it runs.\n\n---\n\n### What to Expect\n\nIt looks like your repository dependencies are already up-to-date and no Pull Requests will be necessary right away.\n\n---\n\n‚ùì Got questions? Check out Renovate's [Docs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/), particularly the Getting Started section.\nIf you need any further assistance then you can also [request help here](https://redirect.github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions).\n\n---\n\nThis PR was generated by [Mend Renovate](https://mend.io/renovate/).
