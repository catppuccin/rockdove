For most users this should be a transparent process, and you should be able to continue to use your existing username and password to connect the Nexus UI. In case you need to update your password, please [follow our documentation](https://central.sonatype.org/register/central-portal/#managing-your-credentials).\r\n>\r\n> To configure a publisher's plugin authentication you would need to update your plugin settings to use [a user token](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/generate-token/) instead of the Nexus UI username and password login.\r\n>\r\n> For more information about publishing to legacy OSSRH please consult our documentation at [https://central.sonatype.org/register/legacy/](https://central.sonatype.org/register/legacy/)\r\n>\r\n> Thank you,\r\n> The Central Team\r\n\r\nI'm a little unsure if we are regarded as a \"publisher\" but we should look to see if we need to switch to a token based authentication workflow.",
